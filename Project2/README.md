Contribution

Gulbadam : Implemented Fibonacci function in MIPS.

Marah : Debugged and tested the MIPS code.

Mira : Wrote documentation and structured the README file.

Judy : Handled input validation and error handling.

GitHub Repository Link: https://github.com/greje3/ECE_366

How to Run the Program:

Download and install the MARS MIPS simulator: MARS Download

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/greje3/ECE_366

Open fibonacci.asm in MARS.

Assemble the program (Assemble button in MARS).

Run the program (Run button in MARS).

The nth Fibonacci number will be stored in memory at the result label.

Expected Output

If n = 10, the output stored in result should be 55 (the 10th Fibonacci number).
